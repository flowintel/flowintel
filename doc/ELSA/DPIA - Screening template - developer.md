# DPIA Screening – Flowintel (Developer)

## Context of processing

* **System:** Flowintel platform (case, task, intelligence and incident handling)
* **Role of Flowintel developer:** Software publisher and maintainer only. The developer does **not** access data, host data, store data, or process operational records.
* **Controller:** Deploying organisation (LEA, CSIRT, governmental body, etc.)
* **Processor (if applicable):** Deploying organisation's chosen hosting or service provider
* **Purpose of processing (as determined by the Controller):** Case and task management, operational follow-up of incidents or intelligence, threat correlation, digital evidence tracking, and reporting.

**Important clarification**: The developer of Flowintel **does not** determine:
* which personal data are collected,
* retention duration,
* sharing policies,
* lawful basis for processing.

These obligations rest with the **deploying organisation**.

## Nature of processing

* Flowintel provides the technical capability.
* All operational and personal data are input, stored, and managed **solely by the Controller**.
* The platform includes:
  * case creation and tracking
  * task workflow
  * note taking and attachments
  * integration endpoints
  * audit logging modules
* No processing occurs by the developer beyond software improvement.

## Types of personal data (defined by Controller)

Flowintel does not collect data itself. The data categories depend on the usage configuration setup by the Controller:

* User authentication records (login name, email, role)
* Operational case content
* Analyst notes, possible identifiers, or evidence
* Access logs generated by the controller's deployment
* Optional technical indicators

**Developer note:**: None of the above are accessed, stored, transmitted, or processed by Flowintel developers.

## DPIA trigger questions (Developer view)

| Screening question                                | Yes/No                     | Notes                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processing involves vulnerable data subjects?     | Determined by Controller   | Developer does not decide case scope.                                  |
| Large-scale monitoring or profiling?              | Determined by Controller   | Depends on deployment size and mandate.                                |
| Data from law enforcement sources used?           | Likely                     | Controller integrates external sources; developer has no access.       |
| Automated decision-making affecting individuals?  | No                         | Flowintel does not enforce automated decisions.                        |
| Cross-border transfers (EU → outside)?            | Determined by Controller   | Depends on hosting and data-sharing architecture.                      |
| Processing of special categories (Art. 9)         | Possible                   | Case content may include sensitive data; Controller governs intake.    |
| Processing of criminal offence data (Art. 10)     | Likely for LEA deployments | Controller holds legal mandate and justification.                      |
| Use of new or untested technology?                | No                         | Platform is mature and openly documented.                              |
| Aggregation of multiple datasets?                 | Possible                   | Controller configures integrations; platform only provides mechanisms. |
| Data retention beyond operational need?           | Determined by Controller   | Retention rules are not set by developer.                              |
| Reuse of intelligence beyond original purpose?    | Determined by Controller   | Governance and sharing agreements outside developer role.              |
| Re-identification risk from technical indicators? | Possible                   | Controlled by Controller through redaction policies.                   |
| Lack of direct visibility by data subjects?       | Yes                        | Operational access rights controlled by Controller.                    |

## Initial screening conclusion

* **Developer position conclusion:**
  The software developer is **not a Controller nor a Processor**. The developer only supplies code and documentation.

* **DPIA requirement:**
  A **DPIA must be performed by each Controller operating Flowintel**, as they determine:

  * purpose of processing,
  * legal basis,
  * retention policy,
  * organisational access controls,
  * international transfers.

## Mitigation & controls (provided by the Flowintel features)

The platform enables, but does not itself operate:

* Role-based access control and organisational scoping.
* Full audit logging of user operations.
* Encryption at rest and in transit (configurable at deployment).
* Separation of case data per organisation.
* Configurable retention schedules.
* Segregated development vs production environments.
* No data ever leaves the Controller’s environment unless configured by them.

**Developer note:**: Implementation, lawful basis, data minimisation, and retention enforcement remain under the responsibility of the deploying Controller.

## Next steps (Controller obligations)

The Controller must:

* [ ] Conduct full DPIA if screening indicates high risk
* [ ] Consult DPO and document advice
* [ ] Define lawful basis for intelligence and operational data processing
* [ ] Establish cross-agency sharing agreements where applicable
* [ ] Implement retention and deletion rules before first production use
* [ ] Validate hosting and access controls through security assessment
* [ ] Confirm audit review schedule (recommendation: quarterly)
* [ ] Document DPIA outcomes and maintain for review
* [ ] Review DPIA annually or when processing activities change significantly

The developer has **no operational access**.
